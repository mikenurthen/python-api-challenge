# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge
THe purpose of this challenge was to take what we've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

I used assistance from ChatGPT, Xpert Learning Assistant, and review of in class example exercises to work on this assignment.
